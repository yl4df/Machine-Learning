        "\"Tonight, more than 130,000 Californians will go to sleep homeless. Thatâ€™s enough to fill Dodger Stadium, AT&T Park and Petco Park. The biggest culprit is rising housing costs. From 2000 to 2014, median rent in California increased by more than one-third, while real incomes for renters fell by 7 percent. Today, 1.5 million Californians spend more than half their income on housing. This crisis threatens not just low-income families but our entire economy, driving businesses to relocate to states in which their employees can afford to live. - **Business Insider, Sep 2018.**\"\n",

        "In this assignment, you will attempt to cluster the California Housing by implementing and analyzing the k-means algorithm to the data. K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. K-means stores k-centroids that it uses to define clusters. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid. For references, you may refer to my lecture 9 or Chapter 2 of the textbook if you need additional sample codes to help with your assignment. For deliverables, you must write code in Python and submit this Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to earn a total of 100 pts.

Using the cluster means and std. deviations as representative values in the cluster, what can you say about the clusters that were found?
