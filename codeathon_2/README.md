# MNIST Classification

In this codeathon, I am in charge of building a system to predict handwritten digits (MNIST 784 dataset). 
My goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images using SVM and to
find the best model given the MNIST dataset. I tune my SVM model using 3-fold cross-validation.
