# Machine Learning

This repository stores my Python codes for CS 4774: Machine Learning at the University of Virginia. The course focuses on the theory as well as application.

Assignments are the implementation of own version of famous models, including regression, SVM, k-means. 
Codeathons are the application of using Machine Learning to solving real-life problems. 
The Project called "Machine Learning For Virginia" is in progress and will update soon.
